About the aMops code generator:

This is the next version of the code generator for what will become the aMops compiler, the next development of 
iMops to run natively on Arm processors (Apple silicon).

It includes emulation of the instructions it generates (but certainly not a full emulator!).

The details of this release are given in [Release notes.rtf](/amops/release-notes/). This also includes instructions for running the project.  If you are new to this project, please read this document next.  We assume you're familiar with iMops.

This code generator is quite sophisticated and incorporates a number of good ideas I've picked up from various places.  It is 
described in "Code generator.rtf".  The code itself is quite extensively commented (which I certainly need myself with a 
project that has already had several incarnations spanning 18+ years!)
