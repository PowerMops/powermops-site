Assigning recognizable names to numbers is a convenient shortcut, as
you've seen with [named input
parameters](/pmops/tutorial/lesson_10#Named_Input_Parameters) and [local
variables](/pmops/tutorial/lesson_10#Local_Variables). But as you saw, both
of those kinds of names are local, they apply only to a very limited
section of the program, inside a definition. But Mops also has a
provision called `VALUE` for assigning
readily-identifiable names to numbers such that they can be used
throughout a program.

Your program can contain many different values because you define each
value by giving it a unique name and a number that it is to hold. You
define a value like this:

`25 value Jane`

In other words, the value named `JANE` is holding the
number 25. To recall a value's number, all you do is type the value
name, and a copy of the number is placed on the parameter stack. Type:

`Jane`

and the number 25 is placed on the stack.

A value is essentially a global version of a local variable (it
accessible to *all* definitions in a program), and responds to similar
operations. To store a different number in a value, you use the gazinta
(the store arrow), like this:

`37 -> Jane`

which writes a 37 over the original number (25). Or you can increment or
decrement the number stored in a value name with the
`++>` or `\-->` operations, like
this:

`17 ++> Jane`\
`4 --> Jane`

which adds 17 to number already stored in `JANE` (37),
then subtracts 4. Of course you can also do a subtraction by
incrementing the value by a negative number:

`-10 ++> Jane`

If you want to define your values at the beginning of a program without
placing specific numbers in them, you can simply place zeros in them
all:

`0 value Joe`\
`0 value Nancy`

and then store (`->`) numbers to them when necessary.

> application without reloading it, your `VALUE`s will
> still contain whatever you last put in them, not their initial numbers.

So much for theory. Now it's time to pull together all the discussions
and examples from the preceding lessons and dive into some real Mops
applications.
